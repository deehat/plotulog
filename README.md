# plotUlog

plotUlog is octave(open source equivalance of matlab) .m script package for plotting ULog files parsed and converted by pyulog. ULog is a self-describing logging format which is documented  [here](http://dev.px4.io/advanced-ulog-file-format.html).

[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is powerful mathmatics software with built in plotting and visualization tools which runs on Linux, macOS, BSD and Windows. 
Tested on Octave **4.4.1** and later.

Please note **plotUlog** is tested under octave version 4.4.2 on ubuntu 16.04.

## Installation


- Install octave on ubuntu

Add ppa to install 4.4.1 or later version of octave
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:octave/stable
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install octave
```
Now Octave can be run from launch bar in ubuntu 

- Install **pyulog** which will parse ULog file and convert to .csv files.

**pyulog** can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/PX4/pyulog)
or visit https://github.com/PX4/pyulog

- clone plotulog git or download and unzip package in any folder.

## File name


Depending on the version of px4 firmware, ULog file can have different names. 

In 1.8.0, ULog files are created as

**/log/yyyy-mm-dd/hh_mm_ss.ulg**

For convenience, change the .ulg file as 

**log###.ulg**

## Run plotUlog

Launch octave and go to the folder you just cloned or unzipped.

Copy a ULog file into the folder.

In octave terminal, enter

```bash
plotUlog("log###.ulg","Description")
```
Description can be any of your choice for identifying the foldr.

**plotUlog** will call **pyulog** to create .csv files under **###_Description/** folder and start generating plots. 

Once .csv files are created you can re-plot by entering the folder created from above.

```bash
plotUlog("###_Description/")
```

## Run compareSensorLogs

Once Ulog files successfully converted to csv file, you can compare two different sensor data each other by calling compareSensorLogs as below
If you have csv files under "001_log" and "002_log", enter 
```bash
compareSensorLogs("001_log/","002_log/")
```

and you will get these plots which makes easier for comparing two different sensor data at the same time.

## Run analyzeSensors

Now you can anaylze accelerometer, gyro data in a designated folder using builtin FFT function by simply run analyzeSensors as below.
If you have sensor_combined_0.csv file under "001_log" folder, enter
```bash
analyzeSensors("001_log/")
```
Or if you want to specify range of the data to look at such as from 50.0 to 77.0, enter
```bash
analyzeSensors("001_log/",[50.0 77.0])
```

## Development


See what's inside the script file and manipulate any of data you want. 

Octave script is similar to matlab code and easy to handle lots of data.
